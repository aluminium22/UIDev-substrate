<!-- The first and great struggle was teaching myself about JSON. I have actually never used it. It was surprisingly easy to grasp, but I had to be thorough. 
Then I tried several different attempts of getting my my objects worked out. Before I linked the JSON to the html, I copy and pasted the JSON into my script tag. This eliminated any chance that the errors I was getting were due to communication between the files. Next, I tried to find a way to efficiently display the information. I had a hard time getting things to display in the html, I would run the browser and nothing would show. 
I did a whole bunch of trouble shooting, fine tuning syntax and mispellings.
initially the Json was all set to a variable, once I finally got everything displaying (images and content and such) I cut the json back into it's folder and deleted the "var data = "portion. There was some trouble shooting to make sure it would still display. This consisted of me trying logical areas and narrowing down the problem. I usually start with the simple things, try, hope it works, if not move to the next.
Once I finally found I could not get it to work without the JSON file right in my index.html file I found that my jquery library (because I wanted to get my info through jquery) was not updating from the link I had originally put in here, I presume it was do to locally testing, which is also what I read was the cause of my code not working in chrome, so I used Mozilla firefox browser, things went smoother from there. I took the whole library and put it in a file my src could reference. 
I developed a loop to output all the images, this simplified and shortened my code, it did make some of the syntax harder for me to spot errors. I had to move p tags here and img tags there to finally get it to display right and I was good!  -->
